@:!! TO DO@> TO DO:  Clean up the conditionally compiled code.  I
think it could be neater.  LDF 2003.08.18.

\LOG
LDF 2003.04.27.  Replaced |tmpnam()| with |mkstemp()|.  The latter
returns a file descriptor, and opens a temporary file.  Since I want
to use the file stream facilities of \CPLUSPLUS/, I have to close the
temporary file that |mkstemp()| opens.  This is a bit awkward, but the
GNU \CPLUSPLUS/ compiler says that |tmpnam()| is dangerous, so it
seemed best to me to handle the problem this way.

LDF 2003.04.27.  Now ``unlinking'' the temporary files.  Now that I'm
using |mkstemp()|, they don't disappear automatically.  I must  use 
|unlink()| to get rid of them.

LDF 2003.04.30.  @: BUG FIX@> BUG FIX:  Now calling 
|unlink(return_value_file_name)| before |exit(1)| when I break off
execution because ctangling or compilation failed.  Previously, the
temporary file was not deleted in these cases.

LDF 2003.08.18.  Combined \filename{procLIN.web} and
\filename{procDEC.web} into this file, and renamed it
\filename{3DLDFprc.web}.  It contains conditionally compiled code, so
that it can be used for compiling with the DEC \CPLUSPLUS/ compiler
under Compaq Tru64, and with both GCC 2.95 and GCC 3.3 under Linux.

@ LDF 2002.4.7.
Added the |compile|$\ldots$ variables and the
code below where it's used.  The latter checks whether
compilation succeeded or not.  If it did, {\tt cmpl} continues;
if not, it exits.  This is what I want most of the time.  It
could possibly be convenient to have it continue compiling so
that I can see all of the errors, but in practice, this is not
usually helpful, since compiler errors in one compilation unit
often cause compiler errors in the others.  Also, even when the
following compilation units are not recompiled, {\tt cmpl} tries
to relink, which is time consuming.  

It's so long since I wrote this function, that I'm not clear in my
mind about how it's nested.  If I was, I'd put the |compile|$\ldots$ 
variables closer to where they're used.


It would be nice to have a command line option that would determine
whether \.{cmpl} exits or not when a compiler error occurs.  However,
even if it doesn't, relinking should be suppressed if one does occur.
@:!!@> !! If I add such a command line option, I must define a 
|bool suppress_relinking|.

@  Files always depend on themselves, so |dependencies| has to have
the bit |compile_and_link_position| set. This causes the
\CPLUSPLUS/ file to be recompiled if the \CWEB/ file is
retangled. Otherwise, this wouldn't happen, or I'd have to make it
happen in another way. 

Run \ctangle/ in the following cases:
\item{$\bullet$} The \CWEB/ file is younger than the \CPLUSPLUS/ file.
\item{$\bullet$} The \CWEB/ file and the \CPLUSPLUS/ file are
                 exactly the same age. Since this shouldn't be
                 possible, we'll assume 
                 something has gone wrong and retangle. 
                 LDF 2002.11.10.  Note that the \CPLUSPLUS/ files are
                 not checked into the RCS archive.
