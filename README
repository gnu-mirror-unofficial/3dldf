* Description of GNU 3DLDF 

GNU 3DLDF is a package for three-dimensional drawing with MetaPost output.

* Documentation

See the directories 3DLDF-2.0.4/doc/ and 3DLDF-2.0.4/doc/old_doc.


* Installing 

The file INSTALL contains generic instructions on installing GNU packages.
They apply to GNU 3DLDF 2.0, however PLEASE NOTE that the environment variable 
`LIBS' must be set to `-lgsl -lgslcblas -lm' when the `configure' script is run, 
e.g.:

   cd <your path>/3DLDF-2.0.4 
   export LIBS="-lgsl -lgslcblas -lm"
   ./configure --prefix=`pwd`

or 

   cd <your path>/3DLDF-2.0.4 
   configure --prefix=`pwd` LIBS="-lgsl -lgslcblas -lm"

In these example, the package will be installed below the current directory,
i.e., the top-level distribution directory.  It is safe to do this.  

Alternatively, the shellscript `3DLDF-2.0.4/reconfig.sh' may be used to call
`configure'.  If `reconfig.sh' is invoked without any arguments, or if its 
first argument is 0, shared libraries will be built.  Otherwise, they won't.
Not building shared libraries is faster.

* Running 3dldf

After the package has been installed, the program `3dldf' may be invoked from
the command-line like this:

    3dldf

The user will be prompted for input.

Alternatively, one or more filenames may be specified:

   3dldf sample.ldf sample1.ldf

The suffix `.ldf' may be omitted.  If an input files has a different suffix,
however, it must be specified.

See the subdirectories `3DLDF-2.0.4/src/' and `3DLDF-2.0.4/examples/' for examples.
