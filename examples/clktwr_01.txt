\centerline{{\largebx Instructions}}
\vskip 1.5\baselineskip

{\bf PLEASE NOTE!}  The author has tried to ensure that the following
plans are correct, but as of May 17, 2010, he has not tested them
yet himself.  As mentioned above, this material is distributed {\bf without
a warranty}.  I recommend that users check it themselves before
investing a lot of time and effort into cutting out the paper model.

Any corrections will be gratefully received by the author.  Contact
information can be found on the title page.

To use these plans, tape, tack or otherwise attach them to a sheet of
heavy paper (I find tacking works best, where possible).  {\bf PLEASE NOTE!}
This version of these plans has tabs that are cut out together with the model
(i.e., in one piece) are not suitable for use with cardboard or Bristol board!  In 
this case, the thickness of the cardboard is significant and the parts won't
match up properly.  Instead, double tabs should be cut out and attached to
each of the pieces that are to be connected.  I plan to add a version of these
plans with double tabs, but have not done so yet (as of 2010.05.17).

The crosshairs on the plans mark places where holes for stitches may be made.
The model may then be sewn together or the stitches may be used to align the
pieces when gluing.

A cutting knife should be used to cut out the {\it outer\/} lines of the plan
and score the lines to be folded.  Some inner lines, such as the traces of the
tabs, are merely for reference and should not be scored.  

Lines to be cut are drawn in solid black while ones that should be scored or
are merely for reference are dashed and/or drawn in gray.  Crosshairs that
mark where holes should be pricked are drawn in solid black, but with a
smaller line width.  Here too, I have tried to be consistent about this but cannot
guarantee that there are no errors.  

The knife must be sharp as heavy paper will dull the blade quickly.
I have been using knives with disposable blades.  I've been meaning to
try sharpening them but haven't done so yet.  I therefore can't say
whether this will work.  It seems a shame to waste so many blades,
which is why I have a jar full of them.  They must be good for
something. 

It will be necessary to reattach the plans to the paper as parts are cut out. 

Please make sure that the plan is taped down smoothly or you will introduce
inaccuracies.  {\it Do not untape it or let it slip until you are
done!\/}  You will never get it back where it's supposed to go. 

If you use tape, please use a removable kind.  Ordinary masking tape will
damage the paper when it is removed.  Be aware that ``removable tape'' isn't
completely reliable, especially if left too long on the drawing.  Sometimes
it's possible to reuse pieces of it, which avoids wasting large amounts of
it.
