{\bf NEW!} 2012.08.06.  Added pyramids for attachment to the octagonal caps.

{\bf NEW!} 2012.08.05.  Added octagonal caps.  They are attached to the
spherical biangles at number 12, where I've added markings for the tab
traces.   The plan for the cap and the tabs are on the page for the 
separate tabs.  The spherical biangles and the tabs will need to be cut off 
beyond the places where the caps are attached.  
accordingly, as soon as I get a chance.  {\bf PLEASE NOTE!}  It may not be
possible to remove the ends of the spherical biangles from the plans, because
this might cause the resulting paths to be drawn inaccurately:  I was working
on subpaths at some time in this past, but I'm not sure if it's possible to draw
portions of paths.  I remember working on this feature, but I don't know
whether I finished it and it certainly hasn't been tested thoroughly.

{\bf PLEASE NOTE!}  The author has tried to ensure that the following
plans are correct, but as of May 31, 2010, he has not tested them
yet himself.  As mentioned above, this material is distributed {\bf without
a warranty}.  I recommend that users check it themselves before
investing a lot of time and effort into cutting out the paper model.

Any corrections will be gratefully received by the author.  Contact
information can be found on the title page.

These plans represent a ``development'' of a sphere:  The individual figures
are ``flattened-out'' spherical biangles corresponding to $1/8$ of a sphere.

This version of the model consists of separate pieces which must be joined by
using tabs placed under the spherical biangles.  They will not be visible when
the model is assembled.

To use these plans, tape, tack or otherwise attach them to a sheet of
paper which should be robust, but not too thick.  I generally prefer tacking
to taping, where possible.

Fairly light, smooth
watercolor paper might be a good choice.  Bristol board or cardboard cannot be
used for this model, because the pieces need to be able to bend.  In addition,
if the paper is too thick, it may be difficult to attach the tabs.  For better
accuracy, it would be necessary to account for the thickness of the paper when
calculating the shape of the tabs.

First, prick out the holes for the stitches and then use a cutting knife to
cut out the {\it outer\/} lines of the plan.  {\bf Please note}:  The {\it
inner\/} lines are only for reference and should not be scored!
%%
%% LDF 2010.06.04.
%%
Crosshairs in black mark the places where holes should be pricked, on both the
pieces and the tabs.  Toward the ends where the curves get very close to the
edges, holes should not be pricked. I have added numbers and tick-marks beside
the even-numbered crosshairs and also further along the curves beyond where
holes should be pricked. The numbers and tick marks should be written on both
sides of the pieces and tabs when they are cut out;  otherwise, it is nearly
impossible to align them correctly when assembling the model.

There are two additional crosshairs at tick mark 15 at the ends of the pieces.
Here, holes should be pricked and a thread run through them for pulling the
ends together {\it carefully\/} to finish assembling the model.

{\bf Please Note}:  This is not an ideal solution for the ends.  A better idea
would be some kind of ``polar cap''.  I will try to work on this as soon as
possible.  (2010.06.04.)

Felt mats are available at hobby supply stores.  I find they work well for
pricking out the holes.

The knife must be sharp as watercolor paper (or other heavy papers) will 
dull the blade quickly.
I have been using knives with disposable blades.  I've been meaning to
try sharpening them but haven't done so yet.  I therefore can't say
whether this will work.  It seems a shame to waste so many blades,
which is why I have a jar full of them.  They must be good for
something. 

It will be necessary to reattach the plans parts of them are cut out.

Make sure that the plan is attached smoothly or you will introduce
inaccuracies.  {\it Do not detach it or let it slip until you are
done!\/}  You will never get it back where it's supposed to go. 
However, with this model, this is only important for an individual piece,
since they aren't attached to each other.

If you use tape, please use the removable kind.  Ordinary masking tape will
damage the paper when it is removed.  Be aware that ``removable tape'' isn't
completely reliable, especially if left too long on the drawing.  Sometimes
it's possible to reuse pieces of it, which avoids wasting large amounts of
it. 

Each figure has three curves on the left and right sides:  
1. the edge of the spherical biangle, 2.  an inner curve for stitches, 
3. the trace of the edge of the tab used to join each piece with its neighbour.
