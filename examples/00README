LDF 2013.11.07.

This directory (`3DLDF-2.0.3/examples/') contains examples of how to use 3dldf 
together with MetaPost, TeX, dvips and ps2pdf to generate three-dimensional graphics.

In order to prevent them from being generated, the `Makefile.am' does not contain rules
for doing this.  Instead, it contains the rule `rebuild', which calls `make' recursively
with the filename `Makefile_sub' as the argument to the `-f' option, i.e.,

   make -f Makefile_sub

The latter file contains rules for creating (or re-creating) the various generated files
by invoking 3dldf, MetaPost, TeX, etc.

Please see the files `Makefile.am' and `Makefile_sub' for more information.

PLEASE NOTE:  In order to reduce the size of the distribution of the GNU 3DLDF package itself, i.e., 
the compressed archive file ("tarball") `3DLDF-2.0.3.tar.gz', the generated PostScript and PDF files
are not included in the distribution.  However, in order to make them available without requiring 
GNU 3DLDF to have been installed successfully previously, they are distributed separately in 
the file `3DLDF-2.0.3-examples.tar.gz', along with the contents of this directory.

`3DLDF-2.0.3-examples.tar.gz' should be available wherever the distribution is, in particular, 
on `ftp.gnu.org/gnu/3dldf' or any of its mirrors.
