Given a circular arc $q$, find the radius $r$ and the angle 
$\theta$ 
subtended by $q$ at the center $M$ of circle $k$.
\vskip\baselineskip
Solution:
\vskip\baselineskip
Let $q$ be the arc of a circle $k$ with unknown center $M$ and 
unknown radius $r$.  
Let $p_0$ and $p_1$ be the end points of $q$.
Let $p_2$ be the point halfway between $p_0$ and $p_1$.
Let $p_3$ be the intersection of $q$ and the perpendicular 
to the line $p_1p_0$ through $p_2$.
Let $p_4$ be the point halfway between $p_0$ and $p_3$.
Let $p_5$ be the intersection of $q$ and the perpendicular 
to $p_0p_3$ through $p_4$.
The lines $p_3p_2$ and $p_5p_4$ intersect at $M$.
Let $a$ be the distance from $p_3$ to $p_2$, i.e., 
the magnitude of $p_3 - p_2$,
$b$ the distance from $p_0$ to $p_2$, and 
$c$ the distance from $p_0$ to $p_3$.
Let $\alpha$ be $\angle p_3p_0p_2$ and $\beta$ be 
$\angle p_0p_3p_2$.  Then $\alpha = \sin (a/c)$ and $\beta = \sin (b/c)$.
Let $\gamma$ be $\angle p_4Mp_3$.  Since $\angle p_3p_4M$ 
is a right angle, $\gamma = \alpha$.  Since the arc 
$p_0p_5$ is a quarter of the arc $p_0p_1$, the angle $\theta$ 
subtended by $q$ at $M$ is $4\gamma$.
