{\bf PLEASE NOTE!}  The author has tried to ensure that the following
plans are correct, but as of October 27, 2009, he has not tested them
yet himself.  As mentioned above, this material is distributed {\bf without
a warranty}.  I recommend that users check it themselves before
investing a lot of time and effort into cutting out the paper model.

Any corrections will be gratefully received by the author.  Contact
information can be found on the title page.

To use these plans, tape or otherwise attach them to a sheet of
heavy paper;  I recommend watercolor paper.  Bristol board or cardboard
may be used for the circular base, but probably will not work well for the
facetted cone.

%% LDF 2009.11.02.
{\bf PLEASE NOTE!}  Tabs that are cut out together with a section of the model
(i.e., in one piece) are not suitable for use with thick Bristol board!  In
this case, the thickness of the cardboard is significant and the parts won't
match up properly.  Instead, double tabs should be cut out and attached to
each of the pieces that are to be connected.  I plan to add plans with double
tabs, but have not done so yet (as of 2009.11.02).

First, prick out the holes for the stitches and then use a cutting knife to
cut out the {\it outer\/} lines of the plan.  {\bf Please note}:  The {\it
inner\/} lines are only for reference and should not be scored!

The knife must be sharp as watercolor paper (or other heavy papers) will 
dull the blade quickly.
I have been using knives with disposable blades.  I've been meaning to
try sharpening them but haven't done so yet.  I therefore can't say
whether this will work.  It seems a shame to waste so many blades,
which is why I have a jar full of them.  They must be good for
something. 

It will be necessary to retape as bits of the plan are cut out.

Make sure that the plan is taped down smoothly or you will introduce
inaccuracies.  {\it Do not untape it or let it slip until you are
done!\/}  You will never get it back where it's supposed to go. 

Use removable tape.  Ordinary masking tape will damage the paper 
when it is removed.  Be aware that ``removable tape'' isn't
completely reliable, especially if left too long on the drawing.  Sometimes
it's possible to reuse pieces of it, which avoids wasting large amounts of
it.
