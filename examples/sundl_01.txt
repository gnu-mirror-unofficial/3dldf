Let $g_0$ and $g_1$ be points on a line passing through the origin
such that the line $g_0g_1$ lies in the x-y plane and its angle to the
x-z plane is $51^\circ 32'$ (the latitude of G{\"o}ttingen, Germany).
$g_0g_1$ represents the gnomon.

Let $c_0$ be a circle with its center at the origin and lying in a
plane perpendicular to $g_0g_1$. Let $r_0$ be the square enclosing
$c_0$ and $r_1$ be a larger square in the same plane as $r_0$ and
$c_0$, whose center is also at the origin and whose sides are parallel
to those of $r_0$.

Let $r_4$ be a rectangle perpendicular to $r_1$ such that the vertices $q_0$
and $q_1$ of $r_1$ are the midpoints of the sides $q_4q_5$ and $q_6q_7$ of
$r_4$.

Let $r_2$ be the rectangle ${q_4}{q_6}{q_9}{q_8}$ such that 
the vectors $q_8 - q_4$ and $q_9 - q_6$ are vertical, i.e., their
y-components are non-zero and their x and z components are 0.

Let $q_{13}$ be the intersection point of the line $q_0q_1$ with the
x-y plane.  The line through the origin and $q_{13}$ is the
intersection of the x-y plane with the plane of $c_0$ and represents 
the projection of the gnomon $g_0g_1$ onto the plane of $c_0$ at noon.
(The section of this line within the circumference of $c_0$ is drawn
in blue.)

The point $q_{10}$ is the intersection of the gnomon $g_0g_1$ with the
plane of $r_2$ and the line $q_{10}q_{11}$ is the intersection of the
x-y plane with the plane of $r_2$.  It represents the projection of
the gnomon $g_0g_1$ onto the plane of $r_2$ at noon.

Let point $p_{75}$ be the point on the circumference of $c_0$ such
that the angle between the line from the origin to $p_{75}$ and the
line from the origin through $q_{13}$ is $15^\circ$ and the
z-coordinate of $p_{75}$ is positive (in a left-handed coordinate
system).  (The point is to the {\it right\/} of the label.  This point
is also labelled 
``\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 13} $(75^\circ)$''.)
The line from the origin to $p_{75}$ thus represents the 
projection of the gnomon $g_0g_1$ onto the plane of $c_0$ at 1:00 PM.

The origin and the points $q_{10}$ and $p_{75}$ determine the plane
$w_0$.  The point $q_{14}$ is an intersection point of $w_0$ with the
rectangle $r_1$ and the point $q_{16}$ is an intersection point of
$w_0$ with the rectangle $r_2$.

The line $q_{10}q_{16}$ thus represents the projection of the gnomon
onto the plane of $r_2$ at 1.00 PM.

The same principle would apply to any ``hour lines'' or other lines
representing time divisions on $c_0$, which represents the
dial of an equatorial sundial:  The intersection of the plane $w_n$ through
the origin, a point on the line representing the time division, and a
point on the gnomon not in the plane of $c_0$ and 
the plane of $r_2$ will be a line representing the same time division
on the plane of $r_2$.  The set of these lines on the plane of $r_2$
would constitute the dial of a vertical sundial.  They would radiate
from $q_{10}$.

In addition, the intersection of a plane $w_n$ representing a time
division on $c_0$ with any other plane $v$ will also represent the
corresponding time division on a dial lying in $v$.

The rectangle $r_3$ was found by rotating $r_2$ about the axis
$q_4q_8$ by $5^\circ$ (counterclockwise as seen when looking 
downward from $q_8$ onto $q_4$).  The point $q_{17} = q_{23}$ was
found by taking the point $q_6$ and performing the same rotation on
it. $r_3$ was then rotated about the
axis $q_4q_{17}$ by $5^\circ$ (counterclockwise as seen when looking 
from $q_4$ onto $q_17$). 

The point $q_{18}$ is the intersection of the gnomon $g_0g_1$ with the
plane of $r_3$.  The line $q_{18}q_{22}$ is the intersection of the
plane $w_0$ with the plane of $r_3$. 
It thus represents the projection of the gnomon onto 
the plane of $r_3$ at 1.00 PM.
