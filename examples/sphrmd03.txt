{\bf PLEASE NOTE!}  The author has tried to ensure that the following
plans are correct, but as of August 6, 2010, he has not tested them
yet himself.  As mentioned above, this material is distributed {\bf without
a warranty}.  I recommend that users check it themselves before
investing a lot of time and effort into cutting out the paper or cardboard 
model.

Any corrections or other feedback will be gratefully received by the author.
Contact information can be found above.

These plans represent a sphere divided into unlike triangles.
The source code can be found in the file {\tt sphrmd03.ldf} which 
is available from the GNU 3DLDF Sphere and Dome Models webpage:\hfil\break
{\tt http://www.gnu.org/software/3dldf/sphrdmmd.html\char`\#Sphere\char`\_Models}

The GNU 3DLDF program that generates the plans and other images in this
document, i.e., the code in {\tt sphrmd03.ldf}, uses parameters for various
values;  in particular, the radius of the sphere and the arc angle that
separates the points on the sphere that are used to find the points on the
triangles.  By changing the values of the parameters, variations of these
plans can be generated.  However, one must be careful, since some values may
cause unforeseen problems or unsatisfactory results, or require changes to
other parts of the program. 

The center of the sphere is located at the origin.
The radius of the sphere used here is $5.375\rm{cm}$.  It was chosen in order
to have (approx.) the largest possible sphere for which the plans would fit
onto a single sheet of DIN A3 paper.

The sphere is divided into 5 ``bands'' plus two pyramids with dodecagonal
bases for the poles.  The bands, in turn, each consist of 12 sets of 4
triangles.  When the model is folded together, each set of 4 triangles becomes 
a pyramid with a trapezoidal base, whereby the the base of the pyramids
belonging to the middle band are rectangular.

The corner points of the trapezoidal or rectangular bases represent line
segments that join points on $30^\circ$ arcs of circles that lie on the 
surface of the sphere and are parallel to one of the major planes 
(and perpendicular to the others).  Other plans may be created by changing the 
angle used for the arcs, but this would certainly require modifying other
parts of the program.  However, it shouldn't be too difficult.

To use these plans, tape, tack or otherwise attach them to a sheet of
paper or cardboard.  I generally prefer tacking to taping, where possible.
Cardboard could be used for this model, since all of the pieces are flat, but
heavy paper would probably also result in an adequately stable model.

This model uses ``double tabs'' for attaching pieces to each other.  The
triangles on the plans on page 4 have traces of the tabs drawn on them.  The
tabs themselves are on page 5.  The tabs can be used for sewing the model
together, either in combination with gluing or alone.  The model can be
assembled by gluing alone, in which case no holes need to be pricked on the
tabs or the triangles.  Nor is it necessary in this case for the tabs to
match up with the traces when assembling the model.

Sewing, however, will generally lead to better results, especially with regard
to the alignment of the pieces.  In this case, the crosshairs in black mark
the places where holes should be pricked, on both the pieces and the tabs.  It
may also be advisable to transfer the lines of the traces to the cardboard or
paper using graphite paper or in some other way.

Felt mats are available at hobby supply stores.  I find they work well for
pricking out the holes.

The solid (outer) lines should be cut out, while the dashed (inner) lines
should be scored only.  I have tried to be careful about drawing dashed and
solid lines correctly, but due to the complexity of this model, I can't be
sure that I haven't made any mistakes until I've tried it myself.  (Even then,
mistakes like this can slip past one easily.)  Please exercise care when
cutting out the model and don't cut through the paper or cardboard if you have
any doubts about a solid line being correct!  However, in an emergency, an
additional tab should fix the problem, if a line is cut through by mistake,
and the difference in the finished model will be negligible.

The knife must be sharp as heavy paper or cardboard will dull the blade quickly.
I have been using knives with disposable blades.  I've been meaning to
try sharpening them but haven't done so yet.  I therefore can't say
whether this will work.  It seems a shame to waste so many blades,
which is why I have a jar full of them.  They must be good for
something.  I don't think scissors would work well for this model, and I don't
recommend scoring with scissors, because this will dull its blade
unnecessarily.  However, this isn't a hard-and-fast rule, if someone prefers
scissors.

It will be necessary to reattach the plans parts of them are cut out.

Make sure that the plan is attached smoothly or you will introduce
inaccuracies.  {\it Do not detach it or let it slip until you are
done!\/}  You will never get it back where it's supposed to go. 

If you use tape, please use the removable kind.  Ordinary masking tape will
damage the paper when it is removed.  Be aware that ``removable tape'' isn't
completely reliable, especially if left too long on the drawing.  Sometimes
it's possible to reuse pieces of it, which avoids wasting large amounts of
it. 

Pages 6--7 contain patterns for the various triangles that appear in the
plans with dashed lines to make it easier to cut them out.  These patterns can
used to cut triangles out of better quality paper, such as watercolor paper,
which can then be attached to the assembled model.  This may improve the
appearance of the model, especially if it is to be painted.  One might also
cut the triangles out of good quality colored paper.
