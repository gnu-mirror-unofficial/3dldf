%% !! Important:  LDF 2010.10.15.
%% I've commented-out some code and rearranged some other code.

%% The MetaPost code generated from this file (in `wave_1.mp') must be altered
%% slightly by hand.  I've check the latter file into the CVS repository.

%% This is necessary, because problems have arisen with |Picture::output| that didn't exist
%% with an older version of GCC.

%% *** (3) Wave forms 1.  LDF 2006.03.03.
