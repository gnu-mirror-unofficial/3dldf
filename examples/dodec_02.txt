{\bf PLEASE NOTE!}  The author has tried to ensure that the following
plans are correct, but as of October 19, 2007, he has not tested them
yet himself.  As mentioned above, this material is distributed {\bf without
a warranty}.  I recommend that users check it themselves before
investing a lot of time and effort into cutting out the cardboard model.

On the other hand, this model is simple enough to be virtually
fool-proof, so I don't expect there to be any terrible errors in it.
It will hardly be a disaster if a tab is out of place, since one could
easily be added after the model's cut out.

Nonetheless, any corrections will be gratefully received by the author.  Contact
information can be found on the title page.

The plans could be improved by using dashed lines for the edges that
need to be scored and solid lines for the ones that need to be cut.
However, this model is simple enough so that this isn't really
necessary. 

It would also be possible with a reasonable amount of effort to remove
the edges of the tabs that extend into the neighbouring face.  I will
do this as soon as I get the chance. 

To use these plans, tape or otherwise attach them to a sheet of
Bristol board or heavy paper.  Then use a cutting knife to cut the
{\it outer\/} and {\it score\/} the inner lines of the plan.  The
knife must be sharp as Bristol board will dull the blade quickly.

I have been using knives with disposable blades.  I've been meaning to
try sharpening them but haven't done so yet.  I therefore can't say
whether this will work.  It seems a shame to waste so many blades,
which is why I have a jar full of them.  They must be good for
something. 

You will probably have to retape as you cut out bits of the plan.

Make sure you tape the plan down smoothly or you will introduce
inaccuracies.  {\it Do not untape it or let it slip until you are
done!\/}  You will never get it back where it's supposed to go.
However, it is possible to start again, make another portion of the
plan and attach the pieces.  There's no real need to make the net in
one piece.

Use ``removable tape'' (or whatever this is called).  Ordinary masking
tape will damage the paper layer of the Bristol board when it is
removed.  Be aware that ``removable tape'' isn't completely reliable,
especially if left too long on the drawing.  Sometimes it's possible
to reuse pieces of it, which avoids wasting large amounts of it.

The right-hand cluster of pentagons, 
$p_0\ldots p_5$ will form the {\it top\/} 
of the dodecahedron.  The cardboard is scored on the top, so that the
pentagons are folded downwards.  The right-hand cluster of pentagons
can be thought of as remaining in place, while the left-hand cluster, 
$p_0\ldots p_5$, is folded around underneath it.

The sides of faces without tabs have a ``trace'' of a tab on them,
indicating where the tab will lie under it.  The dots on the lines
through the middle of the tabs and their traces (lengthwise) indicate
positions where holes can be made for sewing the model together.  This
will only be necessary for the last faces, where there's not enough
room to fit one's fingers inside the model.  

Holes can be made using a needle, if the cardboard isn't too thick.
A small tack or brad can be driven through thicker cardboard.

After the glue has hardened, stitches can be picked out and the ends
snipped off.  If paper is to be glued onto the faces (e.g., watercolor
paper), it may not be necessary to remove every last trace of thread.

I recommend using hide glue, which must be soaked in water and heated
in a glue pot.

I like to glue watercolor paper onto my models, since Bristol board is
not a particularly attractive material.  I will be adding plans for
pentagons in the same sizes as that of the plans for the nets.  The
plans for the nets should not be used for this purpose, because the
pentagons butt up against each other.  To cut out individual pentagons
precisely, there must be gaps between them.
