Release 2.0

* 2013.11.04.  Many changes since release 1.1.5.1.  Most importantly,
	it includes a scanner/parser pair so that the program 3dldf 
        can now be used	interactively.

Release 1.1.5.1

* Added missing Texinfo files to the `3dldf_TEXINFOS' variable in 
  `3DLDF-1.1.5.1/DOC/TEXINFO/Makefile.am', and reordered the filenames. 

* Changed the names of the PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files
  included in the HTML version of the _3DLDF User and Reference
  Manual_.  Changed the names in the commands for including these
  files in the Texinfo files.  I wasn't able to write some of the
  files with the old names to a CD-R (Compact Disk, Recordable).

Release 1.1.5

* In release 1.1.5, I've tied up some loose ends.  I wanted to do this
  before starting on the input routine.  

* Added `const real step' argument to the version of
  Ellipse::intersection_points() that takes an Ellipse
  argument.  
  
* BUG FIX:  Added `touch 3DLDFmp.mp' to the `3DLDFmp.mp' target in
  3DLDF-1.1.5/CWEB/Makefile.am.  This ensures that  
  TeX and dvips will be run if MetaPost is run on `3DLDFmp.mp'.  This happens if
  `3DLDFput.mp' is newer than `3DLDFmp.mp', but the latter isn't changed, so TeX and dvips
  weren't being run.  I'm surprized nobody's complained about this.
  Not yet documented in the _3DLDF User and Reference Manual_.

* Added `PHONY' targets as synonyms for certain targets:
  `cpl' for `3dldf'.  For compiling and linking `3dldf'.
  `mp' for `3DLDFmp.mp'.  For running MetaPost on `3DLDFmp.mp'.
  `ldf' for `3DLDFput.mp'. For running `3dldf'.
  Not yet documented in the _3DLDF User and Reference Manual_.

* It is now possible to ``typedef'' `real' to either `float'
  or `double'.  This means that `real' can now be made a synonym
  for either `float' or `double' by using a `typedef'
  declaration.  `real' is typedeffed to `float' by default.

* Added `const bool ldf_real_float' and 
  `extern const bool ldf_real_double'
  for use in non-conditionally compiled code.  
  They are set according to the values
  of `LDF_REAL_FLOAT' and `LDF_REAL_DOUBLE'. 

* `Transform::epsilon()' and `Point::epsilon()' now return
  different values, depending on the values of the preprocessor macros
  `LDF_REAL_FLOAT' and `LDF_REAL_DOUBLE'.  I have not yet tested
  whether good values are returned when `real' is `double'.  

* `MAX_REAL' and `MAX_REAL_SQRT' are no longer constants.
  Their values are set at the beginning of `main()'.  However,
  users should not change their values.  `MAX_REAL' is the
  second-largest `float' or `double' on a given machine.  This
  now works for all common architectures. 

* Added `namespace System' containing the following functions:
  `get_endianness()', `is_big_endian()',
  `is_little_endian()', `get_register_width()', 
  `is_32_bit()', `is_64_bit()', and the template function 
  `get_second_largest()'.  

  `namespace System' and its functions are documented in
  `system.texi', which is new in edition 1.1.5 of the 
  _3DLDF User and Reference Manual_.

* Replaced the various `create_new_<type>()' functions with the
  template function `create_new()'.  The latter is documented in 
 `creatnew.texi', which is new in edition 1.1.5 of the 
  _3DLDF User and Reference Manual_.

* Added the file `3DLDF-1.1.5/CWEB/cnepspng.el' to
  the distribution.  It contains the definitions of the Emacs-Lisp
  functions `convert-eps' and `convert-eps-loop'. 

* Added the files 
  3DLDF-1.1.5/CWEB/exampman.web and 
  3DLDF-1.1.5/CWEB/examples.mp to the
  distribution.  They contain the C++ and MetaPost code, 
  respectively, for generating the illustrations in the 
  _3DLDF User and Reference Manual_.

Release 1.1.4
* MAX_REAL is now the second largest float value.  However, the
  calculation is system dependent, and will only work on 32-bit
  little-endian architectures.  I will start working on porting this
  soon. 

* Fixed bug in tsthdweb, that caused files to be compiled more often
  than necessary.  It will be necessary to keep an eye on this.

* Added |Rectangle::is_rectangular()|.

* Made |mediate()| a member function of |Point|.

* It is now possible to generate the Texinfo manual in the Info and HTML
  formats. 

Release 1.1.3
* Bug fixes to /3DLDF-1.1.3/CWEB/Makefile.am and /3DLDF-1.1.3/CWEB/tsthdweb.
  Retangling, reCompilation, and relinking should now work properly.
  This was tricky to fix, though, so problems may crop up.

Release 1.1.2
* Minor changes.

Release 1.1.1
* Autoconf and Automake are now used.  

* Made changes to the documentation.


Release 1.0
* Initial release.
