So far, I've been the sole author and user of 3DLDF.
I would be very interested in having other programmers contribute to
it.  I would be particularly interested in help in making 3DLDF conform
as  closely as possible to the GNU Coding Standards.  I would be
grateful if someone would write proper Automake and Autoconf files,
since I haven't yet learned how to do so (I'm working on it).

@xref{Introduction}, for information on how to contact the author.
