	Changed release number to 1.1.5.1.

	* Makefile.am: LDF 2004.01.16.
	Changed names of PNG files.  This was necessary, because I couldn't write
	some of the files with the old names to a CD-R, namely the ones with more than one
	digit in the numerical part of their names.

	Changed the order of the `.texi' files in `3dldf_TEXINFOS'.  They are now no longer
	ordered alphabetically.  Instead, they are in the order of their inclusion in
	`3DLDF.texi'.

	Added missing `.texi' files to `3dldf_TEXINFOS'.

	* instlrun.texi: LDF 2004.01.16.
	Updated copyright date.
	Changed names of included PNG files.  This was necessary, because I couldn't
	some of the files with the old names to a CD-R, namely the ones with more than one
	digit in the numerical part of their names.

	* gstransf.texi, gspoint.texi, gsplane.texi, gspaths.texi:
	LDF 2004.01.16.

	Changed the description of |intersection_points()| with an |Ellipse| argument.
	Documented the new |step| argument.  Corrected an error: |verbose| was erroneously
	said to be |const|.

	* Makefile.am: LDF 2004.01.14.
	Added the variables `3dldf_EPS' and `3dldf_PNG'.  They contain the
	EPS and PNG files for the illustrations in the Texinfo documentation.
	The variables are used in `EXTRA_DIST'.

	Added phony `show' target.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.19.
	Changed the edition number to 1.1.4.2.

	* intro.texi: LDF 2003.12.19.
	Changed what I said about this manual being designed for printing
	only.  It now works to generate Info and HTML output.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.19.
	Changed what I said about the illustrations not being available in
	the HTML output format.  They are now.

2003-12-16  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.16.
	Changed `UPDATED'.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.16.
	Changed `EDITION' to `1.1.4.1'.
	The difference is, that I've added `@ifhtml' and `@ifinfo' code for the
	illustrations.

	PNG files are included in the HTML output.  They are of the correct size and
	use the same fonts as in the TeX output, i.e., Computer Modern.  It wasn't
	easy to get this to work!

	Graphics are not displayed in Info output.  Instead, text indicates that
	``Fig. X'' is not displayed.


	I've put the figure numbers for HTML and Info output into the Texinfo files
	explicitly using Emacs-Lisp.  These numbers are also used to identify the PNG
	files.  This isn't necessary in the TeX output, because I can use `\figcnt'.
	The HTML and Info formats currently don't support incrementing numerical
	variables.

	* add_figure_code.el: New file.

	* regpolyg.texi, utility.texi, polyhed.texi: LDF 2003.12.16.
	Added `@ifhtml' and `@ififno' code for the figures.

	* cuboid.texi: LDF 2003.12.16.
	Added `@ifhtml' and `@ififno' code for the figures.

	Put the TeX code for the figure in an `@iftex' environment.  I missed this file,
	when I did it for the others.

	* solid.texi, pattern.texi, circle.texi, ellipse.texi, rcpcurve.texi, rectang.texi, polygon.texi, path.texi, plane.texi, line.texi:
	LDF 2003.12.16.
	Added `@ifhtml' and `@ififno' code for the figures.

	* gspict.texi: LDF 2003.12.16.
	Removed a `\smallskip' from after `\PEX', so that it doesn't interfere with the
	Emacs-Lisp routine I'm using to insert the figure numbers for HTML and Info
	output.

	* point.texi, picture.texi, label.texi, transfor.texi, instlrun.texi, gspaths.texi, gsplane.texi, gssolfig.texi, gspict.texi, gsdlpt.texi, gstranpt.texi:
	LDF 2003.12.16.
	Added `@ifhtml' and `@ififno' code for the figures.

2003-12-15  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* using.texi: New file.

	* point.texi: LDF 2003.12.15.
	Changed a call to `@UBAR', which I've redefined in `3DLDF.texi'.

	* picture.texi: LDF 2003.12.15.
	Changed two calls to `@UBAR', which I've redefined in `3DLDF.texi'.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.15.
	Redefined `@UBAR'.  The old version caused errors.  It's not usually
	used, because it only occurs in code written to `examples.web'.
	It used to work;  it probably works with a different version of
	Texinfo.  I don't care enough to try to find out, though.

2003-12-14  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* examples.complete.web: LDF 2003.12.14.
	This file contains all of the examples generated by running
	`tex 3DLDF.texi'.

	This version is for 3DLDF 1.1.4, and Edition 1.1.4 of the _3DLDF User
	and Reference Manual_.

	* examples.complete.web: New file.

	* gstranpt.texi: LDF 2003.12.14.
	First revision following release of Edition 1.1.4.

	Corrected a typo.

2003-12-10  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* changes.texi: LDF 2003.12.10.
	Added text describing changes in 3DLDF-1.1.4.

	LDF 2003.12.09.
	Changed calls to |mediate()| in examples and the example code written to
	\filename{examples.web}.

	* point.texi: LDF 2003.12.09.
	Changed description of |Point::mediate()|, which
	is now a |const| member function.

	Changed calls to |mediate()| in examples and the example code written to
	\filename{examples.web}.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.09.

	only run on 32-bit little-endian architectures.

	* glbcnvar.texi: LDF 2003.12.09.
	Added text to the description of |MAX_REAL|.

	* typeglb.texi: LDF 2003.12.09.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info
	and HTML output formats.

	Now using macros for math mode material in one place.

	* transfor.texi: LDF 2003.12.09.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info
	and HTML output formats.

	Put `@iftex' and `@end iftex' around the `@tex' code for generating and including the
	figures.

	Now using macros for some math mode material.

	Added `@ifnottex' code for `@tex' math mode material that I've left in.  In
	particular, there's a lot of math mode material illustrating matrices.

	* solid.texi: LDF 2003.12.09.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info
	and HTML output formats.

	Put `@iftex' and `@end iftex' around the `@tex' code for generating and including the
	figures.

	There was no math mode material in this file.

	* regpolyg.texi, rectang.texi, rcpcurve.texi, polyhed.texi:
	LDF 2003.12.09.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info
	and HTML output formats.

	Put `@iftex' and `@end iftex' around the `@tex' code for generating and including the
	figures.

	Now using macros for math mode material.

2003-12-08  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* polyhed.texi: LDF 2003.12.08.
	Changed node names, menu items, and cross references for `Truncated Octahedron'.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.08.
	Changed menu items for `Truncated Octahedron', since I changed the node names.

	Moved the macro definition for `@bigskip' here from \filename{biblio.texi}, since
	it's needed in \filename{intro.texi}.

	Changed the defintions of `@NEXTFIG', `@PREFIG', and `@TWOPREFIG'.

	Added the macro `@NEQ' for ``\neq''  (not equal).

	Added the macro `@TMS' for ``\times''.

	Replaced `$\neq$' with `@NEQ{}', which I've defined in 3DLDF.tex.

	* picture.texi: LDF 2003.12.08.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info
	and HTML output formats.

	Added `@ifnottex' code for math mode material.

	Made major changes to the way the description of |output()|.  It used to
	use a lot of raw TeX code for formatting.  Now, it's a @table with no
	raw TeX code in it.

	* pattern.texi: LDF 2003.12.08.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info
	and HTML output formats.

	Added `@ifnottex' code for math mode material.

	* path.texi, line.texi, label.texi: LDF 2003.12.07.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info
	and HTML output formats.

	* biblio.texi: LDF 2003.12.07.
	Removed the definition of the macro ``@bibskip'' to \filename{3DLDF.texi}, because
	it's needed in \filename{intro.texi}.

	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info
	and HTML output formats.

	Added ``@iftex'' before ``@tex'' and ``@end iftex'' after ``@end tex''.

	Tried to fix the formatting of ``++'' and ``+-+'' in the description of
	Pythagorean addition and subtraction.  It worked, but not perfectly.
	It might be worthwhile trying to find out how Knuth did it for _The
	METAFONTbook_.

	* utility.texi: LDF 2003.12.08.
	Added `\strut' to a `\sqrt' expression.

	* ellipse.texi: LDF 2003.12.08.
	Added `\strut' to a `\sqrt' expression.  Now formatting
	it separately for the TeX and the non-TeX output formats,

	check in.

2003-12-07  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* ellipint.texi: LDF 2003.12.07.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info and HTML output
	formats.

	Now using `@math' for math mode material.  There was nothing so complicated that
	it needed to be put in ``TeX mode''.

	* color.texi: LDF 2003.12.07.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info and HTML output
	formats.

	Added `@ifnottex' code for math mode material.

	* intro.texi: LDF 2003.12.07.
	Added note to the effect that figures can't be
	shown in the Info and HTML output formats.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.07.
	Added `@copying' and `@insertcopying'.  Updated the `@UPDATED' variable to today's date.
	Changed the macros for printing out the figure number so that they print text when
	using the Info or HTML output format.  Added note to the effect that figures can't be
	shown in these output formats.  Fixed an entry in the main menu for |Trunc_Octahedron|.
	Moved `@end detailmenu' so that it's before `@end menu'.  `@detailmenu' is no longer
	between `@ifinfo' and `@end ifinfo'.  Now using `@ifnottex' in macro definitions.

	* circle.texi: LDF 2003.12.07.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info and HTML output
	formats.

	Added `@ifnottex' code for math mode material.

	* biblio.texi: LDF 2003.12.07.
	Changed this file, so that the entries can be output using the Info and HTML output
	formats.

	I'm not happy with the formatting of the bibliography entries, but I
	wasn't able to fix it.  I tried various solutions involving \hangafter
	and \hangindent and macros, but none of them worked.

	Nor was I able to prevent the displayed comment about Vredemann de Vries
	from being split from the entry.  !! I think fixing these problems
	will involve  fixing texinfo.tex.

2003-12-04  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* Makefile.am: LDF 2003.12.04.
	Removed phony `clean' and `mostlyclean' targets.  The targets
	automatically generated by Automake now work.

2003-12-03  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* utility.texi, transfor.texi, solid.texi, solfaced.texi, shape.texi:
	LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	* regpolyg.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	This file is new.  I removed the chapter on |Reg_Polygons| from \filename{@include polygon.texi}
	to this file, because `texinfo-multiple-files-update' can't cope
	with more than one chapter in a file, and each file should contain a chapter.

	* rectang.texi, rcpcurve.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	* polygon.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	Removed the chapter on |Reg_Polygons| to \filename{@include regpolyg.texi},
	because `texinfo-multiple-files-update' can't cope
	with more than one chapter in a file, and each file should contain a chapter.

	* gstransf.texi, gstranpt.texi, gssolfig.texi, gspoint.texi, gsplane.texi, gspict.texi, gspaths.texi, gsdlpt.texi:
	LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	Moved the macro definitions further down in this file.  They now follow the `@detailmenu' and
	precede the first `@include' command.  This seems to have fixed the problem, that the macros
	were unknown in the included files.

	No longer including \filename{getstart.texi}.  That file is no longer in use, because
	the Emacs function `texinfo-multiple-files-update' can't cope with files that are too deeply
	nested.  The files that were formerly included in \filename{getstart.texi} are now included
	in this file.

	Now including \filename{glbcnvar.texi}, which contains code which was formerly in
	\filename{typeglb.texi}.  I did this, because `texinfo-multiple-files-update' can't cope
	with more than one chapter in a file, and each file should contain a chapter.

	Now including \filename{@include regpolyg.texi}, for the same reason.  It contains text formerly
	in \filename{polygon.texi}.

	* point.texi, plane.texi, picture.texi, path.texi, line.texi, label.texi, io.texi, intro.texi, intersct.texi:
	LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	* instlrun.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	Added a ``TO DO'' item involving the ``Class and Function Reference'' heading.  It used to
	be a node, but it causes problems when making Info output.

	* typeglb.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	Removed text from this file to the new file \filename{glbcnvar.texi}.  I put
	it there, because the Emacs function `texinfo-multiple-files-update' can't cope with
	more than one chapter per included Texinfo file.  In addition, every
	included Texinfo file should have a chapter as its first node.

	* glbcnvar.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	This file is new.  The text it contains was formerly in \filename{typeglb.texi}.  I've
	put it here, because the Emacs function `texinfo-multiple-files-update' can't cope with
	more than one chapter per included Texinfo file.  In addition, every
	included Texinfo file should have a chapter as its first node.

	* focus.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	* ellipse.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	Put the text from \filename{ellipint.texi} into this file, and got rid of
	\filename{ellipint.texi}.  This is because the Emacs function `texinfo-multiple-files-update'
	can't cope with files that are too deeply nested.

	* cuboid.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	* polyhed.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	In this file, I had to fix @nodes and menu entries by hand.

	* color.texi, circle.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	* changes.texi, biblio.texi, addfile.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Made changes, so that `make info' will work.  These involved fixing index entries, removing
	erroneous curly braces, fixing faulty `@def...' commands, changing erroneous invocations of
	TeX macros, and possibly other things.

	However, this file wasn't changed at all.

	* Makefile.am:
	LDF 2003.12.03.  Removed \filename{3DLDFmac.texi} from |3dldf_TEXINFOS|.  I've put the macro
	definitions back into \filename{3DLDF.texi}.  They now are directly before where the `@include'
	commands begin.  Moving them here seems to have solved the problems I was having.  Before,
	they were higher up in the file.  Possibly, they must appear below the `@detailmenu', but I have
	no idea why.

	* Makefile.am: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Got rid of the phony `info' and `info-recursive' targets, because I've got
	my Texinfo documentation to work properly with `make info'.

	Added Emacs ``Local Variables'' list, that sets mode to `Makefile'.

	* regpolyg.texi, glbcnvar.texi: New file.

	* getstart.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Abandoning this file.  The files it included are now included directly
	in \filename{3DLDF.texi}.  This is because the Emacs functions for
	updating menus and nodes can't cope with files that are too
	deeply nested.

	* ellipint.texi: LDF 2003.12.03.
	Abandoning this file.  I've included its contents in
	\filename{ellipse.texi}.  This is because the Emacs functions for
	updating menus and nodes can't cope with files that are too
	deeply nested.

2003-12-01  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.01.
	Added @dircategory and @direntry at the suggestion of
	Andreas Voegele.

	* Makefile.am:
	LDF 2003.12.01.  Changed <Version> to ``1.1.3'' in the first line of this file,
	which contains the filename and path.  This is for the new release.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.12.01.
	Updated |EDITION| and |VERSION| to ``1.1.3'', |UPDATED| to ``1 December 2003'',
	and |UPDATE-MONTH| to ``December 2003''.

2003-11-29  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* changes.texi, addfile.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.29.  Minor change, to account for the fact that I now have
	version 1.1.2, rather than 1.1.1.

	* Makefile.am:
	LDF 2003.11.29.  Changed version number from ``1.1.1'' to ``1.1.2''.

	* 3DLDF.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.29.  Changed VERSION and EDITION from ``1.1.1'' to ``1.1.2''.
	Changed UPDATED from 26 November 2003 to 29 November 2003.

2003-11-28  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdu101.gwdg.de>

	* Makefile.am:
	LDF 2003.11.28.  Added ChangeLog.dev and .rcsfreeze.log.dev to EXTRA_DIST.
	They contain the ChangeLog and the .rcsfreeze.log for my development versions.
	This is now needed, because I have an RCS repository for my release versions.
	I will now delete my development versions, and only continue the versions in this
	repository.

	* varidx.texi, utility.texi, typeglb.texi, transfor.texi, solid.texi, solfaced.texi, shape.texi, rectang.texi, rcpcurve.texi, polyhed.texi, polygon.texi, point.texi, plane.texi, picture.texi, pattern.texi, path.texi, line.texi, label.texi, io.texi:
	New file.

	* intro.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.28.  Minor changes to comments at beginning of file.

	* intro.texi, intersct.texi, instlrun.texi, gstransf.texi, gstranpt.texi, gssolfig.texi, gspoint.texi, gsplane.texi, gspict.texi, gspaths.texi, gsdlpt.texi, getstart.texi, future.texi, funcidx.texi, focus.texi:
	New file.

	* ellipint.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.28.  Rearranged comments at beginning of file.

	* ellipint.texi, dataidx.texi, cuboid.texi, contrib.texi, concidx.texi, color.texi, circle.texi, changes.texi, biblio.texi, addfile.texi, Makefile.am, 3DLDF.texi:
	New file.
