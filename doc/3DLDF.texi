%%%% LDF 2002.12.20.  !! Explain this in README!
%%%% Examples of drawings in Encapsulated PostScript format can be
%%%% included in the printed version of this Texinfo documentation if 
%%%% dvips is used.  If it's 
%%%% available, and the user wants to use it, then the line with
%%%% "\doepsftrue" should _not_ be commented-out, and the line with
%%%% "\doepsffalse" _should_ be commented-out.  Otherwise, 
%%%% "\doepsftrue" should be commented-out, and 
%%%% "\doepsffalse" shouldn't be.  This has the effect that the examples will
%%%% be included, or not.  

%%%% LOG: 
%%%% LDF 2003.01.15.  Modified the following text.
%%%% END LOG.

%%%% LDF 2003.01.12.  To write examples:  

%%%% 1.  Use the macro \BEX to start an example.  It should be in a TeX
%%%%     environment. 

%%%% 2.  Use \BGRP if you want the 3DLDF code to be within a group.
%%%%     \BGRP just writes an open curly brace to subex.web.  Use 
%%%%     \EGRP to end the group.          

%%%% 3.  Use \write\example{...} to write 3DLDF code for the example
%%%%     to subex.web.
%%%%     Remember, if you change the code in the @example environment, you must
%%%%     change the code in \write\example to correspond.

%%%% 4. Use \OEX to call current_picture.output().  \OEX takes an
%%%%    argument which it passes to current_picture.output().  Usually,
%%%%    this will be an argument for the projection, but it can be a
%%%%    complete set of arguments for current_picture.output().  Note
%%%%    that from the point of view of TeX (and texi2dvi), it's a single
%%%%    argument. 
%%%%    This macro also writes its code to subex.web. 

%%%% 5.  Use \EEX to end an example.  Use the argument 1 to draw a box
%%%%     around the example, or 0 to suppress drawing it.

%%%% 6.  Use \PEX to print the example.  It calls \epsffile and inputs
%%%%     the EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) file "3DLDFmp.<\the\figcnt>".
%%%%     It also writes TeX code to 
%%%%     extext.tex for inputting the EPS file.  extext.tex can be input by
%%%%     another TeX file, which makes it possible to view the examples
%%%%     separately.  Currently, it is input by 3DLDFtex.tex.

%%%% 7.  Run texi2dvi to get the example code printed to subex.web.
%%%%     Don't worry if you get an error message, if you've added a new
%%%%     example. 
%%%%     Just type "s" to continue.  If the file 3DLDFmp.<number> hasn't
%%%%     been generated by a previous run throught the procedure, it won't be
%%%%     possible to open it.
%%%%     If all goes
%%%%     well, the next time texi2dvi is run (step 9), it will be available.

%%%% 8.  Make a change to examples.web, so that it will be recompiled.  Then
%%%%     recompile 3DLDF.

%%%% 9.  Run 3DLDF to generate 3DLDFput.mp.

%%%% 10.  Run mp-file to generate the EPS files.

%%%% 11.  Run texi2dvi again.

%%%% 12.  Run d2ps on 3DLDF. 

%%%% 13.  Now you can view 3DLDF.ps using gv (Ghostview), for example.

%% If \makeexamplestrue, 3DLDF code for the example figures is written
%% to \filename{examples.web}.  If \makeexamplesfalse, examples.web
%% isn't written at all.  However, if the Encapsulated PostScript files 
%% \filename{3DLDFmp.1}, \filename{3DLDFmp.2}, etc., containing the figures
%% exist, they will be included by \PEX, unless \doepsffalse.
%% In other words, generating the example figures can be suppressed, for
%% the final version, or for some other purpose.
%% In addition, if \doepsffalse is set, then \makeexamplesfalse is also
%% set.  This is because it doesn't probably doesn't make sense to
%% generate the illustrations, if we're not including them.
