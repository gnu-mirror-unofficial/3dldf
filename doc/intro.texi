This manual documents GNU 3DLDF 3.0 (in the following mostly simply referred to as ``3DLDF'').
The most important difference between release 3.0 and 
previous releases is that 3DLDF 3.0 is an @dfn{interactive} program, whereas in previous 
releases, it was more like a @dfn{library} of @cpp{} classes, functions, etc.@: that users could use 
in their own programs to make drawings.

@cindex language
@c
Now, 3DLDF implements a @dfn{language} similar to the @MF{} language, and in particular
the @MP{} language derived from it.

For several years, interactive versions of 3DLDF have been available for downloading from the
Savannah website:  @uref{https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/3dldf/}.  Release 2.0.3 was the
first one that included this feature.  However, Release 3.0 is the first one which contains
the updated documentation (this document).

@cindex scanning
@cindex parsing
@cindex interpreter
@c
One result of this is that the old manual for releases through 2.0.3
is largely obsolete, as far as the usage of 3DLDF is concerned.  The
reference sections, documenting the classes, functions, etc., are
still usable for those who want to know the details of how the program
works, although many descriptions may be out-of-date because of changes
made in the meantime.  On the other hand, the reference sections are longer 
needed for just using the program.  The old manual is included in the distribution
in the directory @file{3DLDF-2.0.4/doc/old_doc/}.

The code for @dfn{scanning} and @dfn{parsing}, i.e., that
which implements the @dfn{interpreter} that makes the program interactive, 
is of course not documented in the old manual at all.
