	LDF 2003.11.26.  This is the version for 3DLDF-1.1.1.

	* intro.texi: LDF 2003.11.26.  This is the version for 3DLDF-1.1.1.
	Numerous changes because I am now using Autoconf and Automake.  The auxilliary
	program 3DLDFcpl is no longer part of the distribution.  3DLDF 1.1.1 now conforms
	to the GNU Coding Standards, except that makeinfo can't make a functioning
	Info file out of \filename{3DLDF.texi}.

	* intersct.texi: LDF 2003.11.26.  This is the version for 3DLDF-1.1.1.

	* compile.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.26.  This file is being abandoned.  Since 3DLDF 1.1.1, it's no
	longer needed.

	* color.texi, circle.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.26.  This is the version for 3DLDF-1.1.1.

	* changes.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.26.  Initial version.  This file was added for 3DLDF 1.1.1.

	* changes.texi: New file.

	* addfile.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.26.  Initial version.  This file was added for 3DLDF 1.1.1.
	It replaces \filename{compile.texi.}

	* addfile.texi: New file.

	* biblio.texi: LDF 2003.11.26.  This is the version for 3DLDF-1.1.1.

	* 3DLDF.texi: LDF 2003.11.26.  This file has been copied from
	~/metafont/metapost/perspective/RELEASE/3DLDF-1.1.1/DOC/TEXINFO.
	It used to be called \filename{3DLDFman.texi}, but I've renamed it
	\filename{3DLDF.texi}, because Automake expects it to have that name.

	\filename{3DLDFman.texi} has been abandoned.

	The name \filename{3DLDF.texi} had been used in the past, so there's a big jump
	between the last version of this file and this one.

	* 3DLDFman.texi:
	LDF 2003.11.26.  No changes.  Subsequent versions of this file are called
	\filename{3DLDF.texi}, which will be checked in to the RCS repository under
	that name.

	LDF 2003.11.12.  Put the changes that I made in the version of this file for
	the release of 3DLDF 1.0 into this file.  Most of these changes have to do with the

	* intro.texi: LDF 2003.08.27.
	Added and modified text.  Changed ``Accuracy'' and ``Input Routine'' from
	subsubheadings to subsubsections.  The way they were before caused cross
	references to them fail.

	* gstranpt.texi: LDF 2003.08.27.
	Fixed a footnote.

	* gsplane.texi: LDF 2003.08.27.
	Fixed cross references.

	* gspaths.texi: LDF 2003.08.27.

	* 3DLDFman.texi: LDF 2003.08.27.
	Changed the definition of \INT, which prints the symbol for the integers.
	It used to be an ``I'' in the Blackboard bold font, but I've changed it to
	a ``Z'', because I believe ``I'' is used for the irrational numbers.

	It's not important at the moment, because it and the symbols for the natural and
	real numbers are currently never used.  I've commented them out in
	@node Manual Conventions in \filename{intro.texi}, where they were explained,
	because they weren't used anywhere else.

2003-08-25  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* 3DLDFman.texi:
	LDF 2003.08.21.  Set |\makeexamplesfalse|, and added a directory for

	LDF 2003.08.20.  Changed the comment at the top of this file regarding
	the copying conditions.

	* 3DLDFman.texi: LDF 2003.08.20.
	Moved the short contents and contents to the front of the document.
	Removed the @node ``GNU Free Documentation License'' to \filename{fdl.texi}
	and changed the comment at the top of the file accordingly.

	Various minor changes.

	LDF 2003.08.20.  Changed the comment at the top of this file regarding
	the copying conditions.

2003-08-18  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* 3DLDFman.texi: LDF 2003.08.18.
	Added messages to be printed to standard output.

	* gstranpt.texi: LDF 2003.08.18.
	Changed an example.

	* 3DLDFman.texi: LDF 2003.08.18.
	Added \newif\ifmakeexamples.  It is used for enabling or suppressing opening and

	LDF 2003.08.18.
	Put code for the figures between |\ifmakeexamples| and |\fi|.
	This prevents C++ code for the figures from being written to
	\filename{examples.web}, if |\makeexamplesfalse| has been invoked.

	I've done this, so that I can put the Texinfo files in a release, together with
	the Encapsulated PostScript files with the example figures.  This way, Texinfo
	can be run without overwriting the EPS files, and the example figures don't need
	to be generated anew.

	* ellipint.texi, cuboid.texi, circle.texi: LDF 2003.08.18.
	Moved |\ifmakeexamples| and |\fi| around the code that writes to
	\filename{examples.web}.  The way it was before was wrong.

	* ellipint.texi, cuboid.texi, circle.texi: LDF 2003.08.18.
	Put code for the figures between |\ifmakeexamples| and |\fi|.
	This prevents C++ code for the figures from being written to

	2003.05.20.

	* gsdlpt.texi: New file.

	* gstransf.texi:
	LDF 2003.08.15.  Finished typing in corrections from partial print-out from
	2003.05.20.

	* 3DLDFman.texi:
	LDF 2003.08.15.  Changed the way \filename{examples.web} and
	\filename{extext.tex} are written.  On the gwdg-wb01 under Linux,
	I couldn't get {\TeX} to write onto the directory above, even when I
	specified it explicitly, i.e., not using ``~'' or ``..''.

	I've changed the Emacs-Lisp function |texi2dvi-file-ldf| in
	\filename{~/EMACS/tex-functions.el} to correspond:  It now moves
	\filename{examples.web} and \filename{extext.tex} to the directory
	above.

	LDF 2003.08.14.  Finished putting the code that used to be in this file
	into other files, that this file includes.  Fixed an error in one of the
	illustrations.  It required adding error handling code to
	|Circle::operator=(const Ellipse& e)|.

	Now working on typing the corrections from partial print-out from
	2003.05.20 into the included files.

	* point.texi: LDF 2003.08.14.  Added blank line.

	* getstart.texi:
	LDF 2002.08.12.  Removed most of the text in this file, and started putting
	it into other files.  The latter are meant to be included in this one.  This is
	because this file had gotten too big.

	Working on typing in the corrections from the partial print-out from
	2003.05.20.

	* gstranpt.texi: New file.

	* gspoint.texi:

	Typed in corrections from the partial print-out from 2003.05.20.

	* gspoint.texi: New file.

	* 3DLDFman.texi:
	LDF 2002.08.12.  Finished typing in corrections from most recent

	to \filename{ellipses.web}.

	* rectang.texi, polygon.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.25.  Added explanation of a problem involving transforming
	|Reg_Polygons| and |Rectangles|, and how I plan to take care of it soon.

2003-07-20  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* circle.texi:

	* ellipse.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.18.  Working on typing in corrections from most recent
	print-out.

	* path.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.18.  Removed the node ``Comparing Paths'', because the
	only function in it, namely |operator== (Path& @var{p})|,
	hasn't been defined yet.

	* rectang.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.18.  Typed in comments from most recent print-out.

	Added descriptions of |get_axis_h()|, |get_axis_v()|, |out_ellipse()|,
	|in_ellipse()|, |draw_out_ellipse()|, and |draw_in_ellipse()|, all of which
	functions I've added today.

	* polygon.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.18.  Finished typing in the corrections from the most
	recent print-out.  I'd made so many changes to this file since then,
	that it should really be proof-read again.

	* polygon.texi: LDF 2003.07.18.
	Working on typing in the corrections from the most recent print-out.

	Moved the descriptions of the transformation functions,
	|operator*=(const Transform&)|, and |get_center()| from |Reg_Polygon|
	to |Polygon|.  Also removed the descriptions of the |Rectangle|
	versions in \filename{rectangs.web}, except for |get_center()|, which was
	missing.  Since |Reg_Polygon| and |Rectangle| are derived
	from |Polygon|, they inherit the |Polygon| versions of these functions.

	* rectang.texi.~1.12~: New file.

	* rectang.texi: LDF 2003.07.18.
	Removed the ``Affine Transformations'' section.  The functions described
	in it are now members of |Polygon|, and inherited by |Rectangle|.

	Formatting changes.

	print-out.

	* 3DLDFman.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.16.  Added alternative formulation for my ``|\openout|" commands,
	because the ones I had didn't work on the gwdg-wb06.  The variants that
	shouldn't be used, should be commented-out.

	* circle.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.16.  Removed the ``Segments'' section to \filename{rcpcurve.texi},
	since I've removed the functions from |Circle| and put them into
	|Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve|.

	* rcpcurve.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.16.  Typed in corrections from most recent print-out, except for
	``Segments'' section.  I'll do those, when I get to that part of the print-out.
	I've moved the functions from |Circle| to |Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve|, so the descriptions
	are further down in the print-out.

	* path.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.16.  Finished typing in corrections from most recent print-out.

	description of |intersection_point()| to account for the addition of the
	|const bool trace| argument, and added illustration.

2003-07-02  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* rectang.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.02.  Separated the descriptions of the constructor
	and setting function taking arguments for the center, lengths,
	and angles of rotation.  Added illustration to constructor
	description.

2003-07-01  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* 3DLDFman.texi: LDF 2003.07.01.  No significant changes.

	* path.texi: LDF 2003.07.01.  Minor formatting changes.

	* ellipse.texi:
	LDF 2003.07.01.  Added illustrations to the ``Intersections'' and ``Rectangles''
	sections.  Removed the ``Intersections'' section to \filename{ellipint.texi},
	because some of the 3DLDF code that generates the illustrations takes
	a fairly long time to run.  It must be ``@included'', when the final draft
	is generated.

	* ellipint.texi: New file.

2003-06-29  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* ellipse.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.29.  Adding illustrations.  About to start working on the description
	of the version of |intersection_points()| taking an |Ellipse| argument.

	* 3DLDFman.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.29.  Changed the definition of |\PEX|, so that I can chose
	what version of the program I use for the illustrations, i.e., the one for
	Linux, DEC ALPHA, or FREEBSD (which doesn't exist yet).

	* contrib.texi: LDF 2003.06.29.  Added a small amount of text.

	* polygon.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.29.  Wrote descriptions of the two versions of |intersection_points()|
	with examples.

	* point.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.29.  Rewrote the description of |intersection_points()| and
	added examples.

2003-06-20  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* rcpcurve.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.20.  Updated the description of |intersection_points()|
	and added examples.

2003-06-13  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* 3DLDFman.texi: LDF 2003.06.13.  Added notes to myself.

2003-06-11  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* transfor.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.11.  Added descriptions of |INVALID_TRANSFORM| and
	|IDENTITY_TRANSFORM|.

	* rectang.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.11.  Removed description of |center|, because I've made it
	a data member in |Polygon|, and removed it from |Rectangle|.

	* polygon.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.11.  Made changes reflecting the fact that I've made |center|
	a data member in |Polygon|, rather than in |Reg_Polygon| (and |Rectangle|).

	* point.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.11.  Added description of |is_in_triangle()|, which I've added today.

	* picture.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.11.  Added text documenting |current_picture|.

2003-06-06  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* point.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Removed the text for ``next, ``previous'', and
	``up'' from a @node line.

	* picture.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Removed the text for ``next, ``previous'', and
	``up'' from a couple of @node lines.  I find them confusing and they're not
	needed for the way I'm using Texinfo now.

	* 3DLDFman.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Added ``\nobreak'' preceding the figure number, so it should
	always appear on the same page as the figure.  Since they're in a
	\vbox anyway, I don't know why a page was broken between them in one place.

	* transfor.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Working on the descriptions of the global constants and
	variables.

	* focus.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Added description of the global variable |Focus focus|.

	* point.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Corrected an error in the description of |get_line()|.

	* path.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Added description of the new function |get_line()|.

	* line.texi: LDF 2003.06.06.  Added some text.

	Revised the description of the constructor fixed the example and figure illustrating.

	Removed the description of |magnitude()|, because I've removed the function
	from |lines.web|.  It doesn't make sense for |Lines|, since they are considered
	to have infinite extension.

	Added description of the new function |get_path()|.

	Edited description of |show()| and the example.

	* plane.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Finished the first version of this file.  It now contains
	a complete description of |struct Plane|.

	* polygon.texi: LDF 2003.06.06.  Commented-out the descriptions of
	the three versions of |Polygon::intersection_points()|.  They are currently
	not usable.

	* polygon.texi: LDF 2003.06.06.  Minor correction.

	* polygon.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Added the chapter ``Polygon Reference''.  Moved the
	descriptions of the intersection functions from ``Regular Polygon Reference''
	to ``Polygon Reference'', to reflect the fact that they are now member
	functions of |Polygon| rather than |Reg_Polygon|.  Removed the descriptions of
	these functions, since I've replaced them with dummy definitions in
	\filename{polygons.web}.  I plan to replace the definitions with new ones, that
	handle the non-coplanar cases.  In order to do this, I must add a function
	that tests inclusion of a |Point| within a triangle.

	* rectang.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.06.  Minor change, to reflect the fact that |Rectangle| is
	now derived from |Polygon|, rather than |Path|.

2003-06-04  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* plane.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.04.  Finished the descriptions of the intersection functions.
	Working on adding descriptions of other functions.

	* plane.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.04.  Working on the descriptions of the intersection functions.

	* point.texi: LDF 2003.06.04.  Added description of |is_on_plane()|.

	* plane.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.04.  Working on describing functions.  Added two fairly complicated
	figures, so I want to save this version of this file.

	* path.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.04.  Edited description of |get_plane()| and added example.

2003-06-03  Laurence Finston  <lfinsto1@gwdg-wb01.gwdg.de>

	* typeglb.texi:

	* input.texi: LDF 2003.06.03.  Minor additions.

	* plane.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.03.  Initial version.  Currently working on writing descriptions of
	the |Plane| functions.  I've had to work on \filename{planes.web}, because
	some of them weren't working properly.  I may have to work on
	|intersection_line()|, since I don't think I've tested it properly.
	It may be a good idea to add one or more functions for drawing |Circles|
	and/or |Rectangles| that lie in a particular |Plane|, in order test the latter,
	or make illustrations.

	* line.texi: LDF 2003.06.03.  Minor formatting change.

	* 3DLDFman.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.03.  Added the files \filename{line.texi} and
	\filename{plane.texi}.

	* line.texi:
	LDF 2003.06.03.  Initial version.  This file contains a description of
	|struct Line|.

	* plane.texi, line.texi: New file.

	LDF 2003.05.31.  Changed names of several nodes, i.e., removed ``Intro''
	from name of node.  This was possible, because I'm calling the later
	chapters ``Point Reference'', ``Path Reference'', etc.

	Changed paragraph about comparisons for the hidden surface algorithm, and
	added a figure containing a chart.
