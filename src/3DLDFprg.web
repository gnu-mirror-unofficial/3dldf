The way CWEAVE handles indexing is not
ideal for \CPLUSPLUS/. 
It doesn't index identifiers that include non-alphanumeric characters,
so that neither |Path::draw()| nor |operator<<()| are indexed
automatically. 
Nor is there any indication of whether an identifier refers to a
variable or a function.  

I have added indexing commands in the source files for operators and
class member functions.  However, the alphabetization routine is
na{\"\i}ve and doesn't
ignore the characters of the {\TeX} macros that I use for
formatting the index entries, so the order of the entries is a bit
peculiar.  For example, 
{\tt \char`\\cfunc\char`\{z\char`\}} would come before  
{\tt \char`\\ofunc\char`\{a\char`\}} ({\tt \char`\\cfunc} is for class
functions, and {\tt \char`\\ofunc} is for operators that aren't
members of a class).  

First come the index entries which start with ``??'' and ``!!''.
These are followed by
the non-operator class member functions
for all of the classes.  Then come the class member
operators for all of the classes, followed by the non-class operators.  
Currently, I'm only putting index entries in by hand where the class
member functions and operators are declared.

Another problem is that ``\\{operator\AM}'' and
``\\{operator\AM=}'' use the italic ampersand.  It would be possible to
fix this, but slightly tricky.  \initials{LDF 2002.10.11.}  

The problems with the index can all be solved by using the ``\.{@@=}'' 
CWEB control code. \initials{LDF 2004.02.12.}
