@** Introduction\quad ({\tt 3DLDF\PERIOD web}).\hfil

This book contains the program code of GNU 3DLDF, along with
explanations.  For information on {\it using\/} 3DLDF see
the {\it 3DLDF User and Reference Manual\/}, which should have been in
the distribution along with this book.

GNU 3DLDF is a free software package for three-dimensional drawing written by
Laurence D. Finston, who is also the author of this manual.
It is written in \CPLUSPLUS/ using CWEB and it outputs MetaPost code. 

In the text sections of the \CWEB/ documentation, I note
things about \CPLUSPLUS/ that may be of interest even if they are
obvious to people with experience. 
  
The various files that make up 3DLDF are ctangled and compiled
separately (see the chapter ``Compiling'' in the 
{\it 3DLDF User and Reference Manual\/}) and the resulting object 
files are then linked.  However, the file \filename{3DLDF.web}, which
contains no \CPLUSPLUS/ code and is not ctangled, includes the other
\.{.web} files, so that cweave processes them as if they were all one
file. 

To write my \.{.web} files, I wrote a \.{cweb-mode} for Emacs and a
number of Emacs-Lisp functions to go with it.  It is not currently
included in the 3DLDF distribution (Version 1.1.4), but I may include it in a
later version.  However, GNU is at work at an official cweb-mode of
its own, so you might want to use it instead, if it's available.

@q  Mention changes to\filename{cwebmac.tex} and what @>
@q  \filename{3DLDF.macs} does.      @>

@q  Mention problems with \CPLUSPLUS/ and \CWEB/, how the latter is not @>
@q  really set up for the former. @>

Plurals of types are typeset with the ``s'' in the same font as the
type, e.g., ``|Points|'' and not ``|Point|s''.  It's not considered
good typographical practice to typeset words with letters from
different fonts.  
@q @@:!!@@> !! Look for reference!@>
The second example does have the advantage that it's
somewhat clearer what the actual name of the type is, but I think the
first argument is weightier.

@q Go into Stroustrup's recommendations and his objections to the @>
@q preprocessor.@>

See {\tt http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/knuth/cweb.html} for
more information about CWEB.  The WEB (for Pascal) and CWEB packages are
available from the CTAN archive, {\tt ftp.dante.de}  
and\hfil\break
{\tt http:://www.dante.de}.

Donald Knuth's books 
{\it {\TeX}: The Program\/} and {\it \MF/: The Program\/} each  
include a section ``How to read a WEB'', which may
be helpful.

\LOG
\initials{LDF 2002.11.18.}  Changed name of this file from
\filename{cweavedriver.web} to \filename{cwdriver.web}.  It now has
fewer than 8 letters and can be used under DOS.

\initials{LDF 2003.08.16.}  Changed name of this file from
\filename{cwdriver.web} to \filename{3DLDF.web} sometime since
2002.11.18.  Forgot to note it here.

\initials{LDF 2003.11.12.}  Removed the version control identifiers from the CWEB
files for the distribution of 3DLDF 1.1.  They're still used in my
development versions.
