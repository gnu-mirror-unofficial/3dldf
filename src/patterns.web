When you add a new \filename{.web} file and move code to it by copying
it from another \filename{.web} file, remember to change the name of
the header file that it writes.  Otherwise, this can cause problems
and it's not obvious what's caused them.

\LOG
\initials{LDF 2002.09.21.}  
Started using this file again.  Moved
|hex_pattern_1()| here.  Made the appropriate changes to
\filename{cmplprsp.web} and \filename{main.web}.  

\initials{LDF 2003.11.12.}  
Removed the version control identifiers from the CWEB
files for the distribution of 3DLDF 1.1.  They're still used in my
development versions.

\initials{LDF 2003.12.10.}  
Put the version control identifiers back
into my release versions for 3DLDF 1.1.4.  I've already put some of
them back in, now I'm doing the rest of them.  However, the release
versions are now in their own RCS repository.

\initials{LDF 2003.08.10.}  @:!! TO DO@> TO DO:  Change, so that it's possible to
put the pattern into a rectangular area.

\LOG
\initials{LDF 2002.09.22.}  Added arguments.  |hex_pattern_1()| can now be used
to make a pattern with up to three nested hexagons which can be drawn
and filled.  Each hexagon has its own argument for the draw color, the
fill color and the pen to be used.  |hex_pattern_1()| does not have
arguments for dash patterns, but they could be added, if necessary.
If the argument for the diameter of the middle or the inner
hexagon is 0, then that hexagon is not drawn or filled.  In this case,
the arguments for the draw and fill colors are ignored for that
hexagon.  The default pen for the outer hexagon is thicker than the
pens for the other two (.5mm and .3mm, respectively).

\initials{LDF 2002.09.20.}  Rewrote this function.
It now works with the new |project()| function.  
|hex_pattern_1()| makes a ``honeycomb'' pattern on the x-z plane using
a single hexagon (i.e., there aren't nested hexagons yet, as in the
old version).  In the next version, I plan to add arguments for
optionally putting two smaller hexagons inside the large one, and for
filling and unfilling.  

This version contains arguments for the drawing command, including a
|Picture| argument, so that |hex_pattern_1()| need not be put onto
|*current_picture|.

\initials{LDF 2004.05.26.}  Made |Picture& picture| the first argument 
and removed the default, which was formerly |current_picture|.

\initials{LDF 2004.06.02.}  Removed the |string| arguments for |pen_outer|,
|pen_middle|, and |pen_inner|.  They are now |Pens| and are declared within the
function.  Changed the |Color| arguments to pointers to |Color|. 

\initials{LDF 2004.06.07.}  Changed the code that uses |Dash_Patterns|.
I have changed |string Path::dashed| to |Dash_Pattern* Path::dash_pattern|.

@q ** Epicycloid pattern 1.@>
@ Epicycloid pattern 1.
\initials{LDF 2003.02.11.}  This functions works well for outer |Circles| with
radii that are divisors (with no remainder) of the radius of the inner
|Circle|.   
Each outer |Circle| is rolled around the inner |Circle| once only.  If
the radius of the outer |Circle| is a divisor of the inner |Circle|,
the end of the epicycloid will meet up with the beginning.  If the
radius of the outer |Circle| is not a divisor of the inner |Circle|,
it won't.  See |epicycloid_pattern_3()| below, for a pattern that
works well for outer |Circles|, whose radii are not divisors of the
radius of the inner |Circle|.
\LOG
\initials{LDF 2003.02.09.}  Added this function.

\initials{LDF 2003.08.27.}  Removed the declaration |const Color* curr_color|,
since |curr_color| was never used.

\initials{LDF 2004.01.18.}  Now starting from beginning of |Color*|
vector, if I get to the end.

\initials{LDF 2004.05.26.}  Made |Picture& picture| the first argument 
and removed the default, which was formerly |current_picture|.

\initials{LDF 2004.06.02.}  Changed calls to |draw()| to reflect the
fact that it now takes a |Color*| argument rather than a |Color|.

\initials{LDF 2004.06.07.}  Changed the code that uses |Dash_Patterns|.
I have changed |string Path::dashed| to |Dash_Pattern* Path::dash_pattern|.

\initials{LDF 2004.06.07.}  Removed default for |colors|, because 
I've gotten rid of |Colors::default_color_vector|.

\initials{LDF 2004.06.08.}  Changed |origin| to |origin_pt|, because I've
removed the global variable |origin|.  I'm replacing it with a predefined
variable defined in |Scanner_Type::create()|.
