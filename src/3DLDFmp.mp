%% LDF 2003.01.15.  Added the following two lines.  This sets the
%% margins of the boxes around the examples.  The original default is
%% 3. 
defaultdx:=.75cm;
defaultdy:=.75cm;
  
%input 3DLDFput.mp 

%% * (1) Now inputting `sample2.mp' instead of `sample1.mp' or `sample0.mp'.
%%       `sample0.ldf' has gotten so large that I've switched 
%%       to using `sample2.ldf' for the current sample code.  When I'm done with it,
%%       I'm now putting it into `sample1.ldf'.  It's easier to search `sample2.ldf'
%%       if the older samples are removed.
