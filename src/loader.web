@q * (1) Preprocessor variables and library files.@>
@** Preprocessor variables and library files\quad ({\tt loader\PERIOD web}).\hfil
\initials{LDF 2002.10.15.}
It would, of course, be possible to put this code into a \.{.h} file
directly, but it's convenient to have a \CWEB/ file so that it can be
\.{cweaved} along with the rest of 3DLDF.

\initials{LDF 2003.07.18.}  
Set the preprocessor macro |LDF_GCC_3_3| to 1 in
order to compile using  
gcc version 3.3 20030226 (prerelease) (SuSE Linux).  
Set it  to 0 in order to compile
using GCC version 3.95.3 20010315 (SuSE).
This can be faster than using GCC 3.3, especially with respect to 
linking.  

\LOG
\initials{LDF 2003.08.21.}  Now including \filename{plfmvar.h}.  
It contains 
|@[#define@]| and |@[#undef@]| preprocessor commands for conditional
compilation. 
There's a different version of this file in each of the subdirectories
used for compiling with a different combination of operating system,
compiler, and compiler version.

\initials{LDF 2003.07.25.}  Modified the conditional constructions governing
compilation slightly.

\initials{LDF 2003.08.14.}  Now including \filename{getopt.h} for the GCC
versions under Linux.  It's for processing the command line options.

\initials{LDF 2003.08.14.}  Now including \filename{streambuf.h}, if
|LDF_GCC_2_95| is defined, otherwise \filename{ios}.  This is for
stream formatting.

\initials{LDF 2003.08.29.}  Removed \filename{getopt.h} to \filename{main.web},
because it's only used there.  

\initials{LDF 2003.09.03.}  Added |@[#define@]| |LDF_PUBLIC| in order to be
able to conditionally include \filename{plfmvar.h}.  The latter is not
included in the version for distribution.  Instead, the preprocessor
variables are defined or undefined here.

\initials{LDF 2003.11.12.}  Removed the version control identifiers from the CWEB
files for the distribution of 3DLDF 1.1.  They're still used in my
development versions.
\ENDLOG 

@q * Configuration file.@>
@ Configuration file.@>
This section includes \filename{config.h}, which is generated by
\.{configure}.  This is new in 3DLDF 1.1.  The \.{configure} script
generated by Autoconf tests whether certain library files are present,
and defines preprocessor variables in \filename{config.h} accordingly.
These can be used for conditionally compiling code, so that 
library files are only included if they are really present.  However,
it will be necessary to add code for handling the case that they
aren't present.  I haven't done this yet, although I have put in
conditional code using these variables in a couple of places.  
@:!! TO DO@> TO DO:  Work on this.  \initials{LDF 2003.11.12.}

Autoconf does not per default check the version of
the compiler that's used, and I'm not sure whether this would really
be sensible.  3DLDF already contains conditionally compiled code based
on whether the DEC \CPLUSPLUS/ compiler, or the GNU \CPLUSPLUS/
compiler (GCC) version 3.95 or version 3.3 is used.  
If the DEC compiler is used, the preprocessor variables |LDF_GCC_2_95|
or |LDF_GCC_3_3| must be undefined by hand below.  It defines
|__DECCXX| itself.  If GCC is used, 
one of them must be defined, and the other undefined.  Per default,
|LDF_GCC_3_3| is defined and |LDF_GCC_2_95| is undefined. 
This is because GCC 3.3 is, in general, an improvement over GCC 2.95.
However, I usually use GCC 2.95 myself, because linking is
significantly faster on the computer I use.  \initials{LDF 2003.11.12.}

|DEBUG_COMPILE| is used for conditionally compiling debugging code.
In general, the debugging code will be inside a conditional using
|DEBUG| or a similar local variable.  In productions versions, |DEBUG|
will normally be |false|, but it users can set it to |true| either in
the source code or when running 3DLDF under the control of a
debugger.  \initials{LDF 2004.04.22.}


\LOG
\initials{LDF 2003.11.12.}  
Added this section.

\initials{LDF 2003.12.17.}  
\filename{config.h} is now not included if
I'm with the DEC \CPLUSPLUS/ compiler.  This is because because
building with Autoconf, etc.,
doesn't work on the DEC Alpha machine I'm using.

\initials{LDF 2004.04.22.}  
Added |DEBUG_COMPILE|.  

\initials{LDF 2004.07.02.} 
Now only declaring |DEBUG_COMPILE| if it's undefined.  
It should now be defined and set to either 0 or 1 in \filename{config.h} 
according to whether the options \.{--disable-debug-compile} 
or \.{--enable-debug-compile} are used or not.  The default is 1, so that
conditional compilation of debugging output is enabled.  If for some reason it's
not defined in \filename{config.h}, it's defined and set to 1 here.
