|Shape| is an abstract class.  This means that no
objects of type |Shape| may be declared.  |Shape| is used as a base
class for all ``drawable'' classes, e.g., |Point|, |Path|, and
|Dodecahedron|.  All objects that are put onto a |Picture| must be
either |Shapes| or |Labels|.

\LOG
\initials{LDF 2003.11.12.}  
Removed the version control identifiers from the CWEB
files for the distribution of 3DLDF 1.1.  They're still used in my
development versions.

\initials{LDF 2003.12.10.}  
Put the version control identifiers back
into my release versions for 3DLDF 1.1.4.  I've already put some of
them back in, now I'm doing the rest of them.  However, the release
versions are now in their own RCS repository.

@q *** (3) |Shape| function declarations.@> 

@ |Shape| function declarations.  All |Shape| functions are pure
virtual functions. 
\initials{LDF Undated.}

I've thought about getting rid of |get_copy| a
couple of times, and using\break 
\.{create\_new\_}\<type>||
instead, but it's not possible:  |get_copy| is used in |Picture|
functions for objects of types derived from |Shape| where the type is
not known.  The compiler must resolve to the correct version of
|get_copy|, so a |virtual Shape| function is needed.  The 
``\.{create\_new\_}\<type>||''
functions are not
|virtual Shape| functions, and can't be, because the names of the
types are part of the name of the functions.  I could solve this
problem by renaming |get_copy| |create_new|, but what I wanted to
do was have a template function |create_new| (or just |create|).
So far, I haven't been able to get this to work.  So, for the time
being, I'm leaving things as they are.
