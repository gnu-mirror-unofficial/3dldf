%% * (1) Emacs-Lisp code for use in indirect buffers when using the          
%%       GNU Emacs editor.  The local variable list is not evaluated when an 
%%       indirect buffer is visited, so it's necessary to evaluate the       
%%       following s-expression in order to use the facilities normally      
%%       accessed via the local variables list.
