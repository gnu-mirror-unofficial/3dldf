I am pleased to announce the release of GNU 3DLDF 2.0.1.

This is a bug fix release.

GNU 3DLDF is a package for three-dimensional drawing with MetaPost output.

The package can be downloaded from ftp.gnu.org/gnu/3dldf/.  
Alternatively, http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/3dldf/ will automatically redirect to a nearby mirror.

It is also available from the Git repository for project at Savannah:

git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/3dldf.git


Changes since release 2.0:

2013.11.10.

        * 3DLDF-2.0.1/src/paths.web, 3DLDF-2.0.1/src/pntrvctr.web
        
        Changed the type of derivation of `class Path' from `class Shape' from `protected' 
        to `public'.
        
        In the template function `Pointer_Vector<C, D>::convert':  Now explicitly 
        resizing a `vector<C*>' with `static_cast<C*>(0)' as the value.

        Previously, a compilation error occurred when compiling with GCC 4.8.2.  
        It had still worked with GCC 4.6.2.
