I am pleased to announce the release of GNU 3DLDF 2.0.2.

This is a bug fix release.

GNU 3DLDF is a package for three-dimensional drawing with MetaPost output.

The package can be downloaded from ftp.gnu.org/gnu/3dldf/.  
Alternatively, http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/3dldf/ will automatically redirect to a nearby mirror.

It is also available from the Git repository for project at Savannah:

git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/3dldf.git


Changes since release 2.0.1:

2013.11.10.

        * 3DLDF-2.0.2/reconfig.sh
        
        Restored original call to `configure'.  I had changed it so that it contained
        site-specific arguments.  This would have failed on other systems.

        This would matter if this shellscript was used to call `configure'.
        It exists merely as a convenience; `configure' may be called directly,
        in the normal way.  However, since `README' refers to it, it seemed to
        me to be necessary to create a new release with this error corrected.
